    If you want to know the properties and methods of an object or
    module, use the dir() function. Below, we are checking for the
    properties and methods of a string object. You can also use dir()
    to check the properties and methods of modules. For instance,
    if you wanted to know the properties and methods of the
    collections module, you could import it and pass it as an
    argument to the function print(dir(collections))
